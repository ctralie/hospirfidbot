For some reason when I try to log the camera data to separate files using the "camera_save_images" flag, it says "Warning: unsupported compression method," which I've pinpointed to line 2165 of writelog.cc.  It needs to be in an uncompressed format in order for that to save, which I admittedly don't understand since the CameraProxy seems to be able to save JPEG images.  I'm going to instead log the hex information to the log files as a string and then output it to jpeg files
